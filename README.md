# small-js-games

This repo will be filled with small, most likely single-file games created in HTML5 with canvas, JavaScript, and a dab of CSS. These games are programmed quickly and without finesse, so yes, the code will be lazy and sloppy, just as the username suggests. This is more about having fun than creating masterpieces of code. Please feel free to play around with the code, modify, etc.
